# Business Site

For this task I created a simple business site for online bakery classes. The site is built with a Hero image, signup form and simple QA with accordion.  

## The problem

The first thing I did when I got the task was to look through different images/websites to find some inspiration for my project. After deciding that the subject should be about beauty, I started to download the images I wanted to use from unsplash.com, fonts from google and got inspiration for color from coolors.co.

The header with the hero image and the signup form was easier to create and that's because I have done it before. However, I thought it was fun to learn more about srcset, how to test a form with httpbin and style different validations. 

I did have some problems with the accordion. After succeeding with the toggle part I had a hard time to understand how to handle the height of the whole container. Because when I opened every section, it took a lot of the height and also overflowed a bit. I managed to fix it by adding more height and with flexbox. 

I also tried to watch on YouTube about how to fix the accordion's height and found a video about making one part collapse when another opens. I managed to solve my problem but because of lack of time I couldn't understand what I did and why it worked. Therefore I decided to comment out that part of the code and when I get more time and learn more about JavaScript I will try to redo it.
